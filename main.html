                                               <br>

                <br><br>

<p>
                Design seems like a really broad field and kind of something maybe you can just pick up. I mean, <span style="font-weight:700">do you even have to go to school for that?</span></p>

                                <br><br>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                Actually, yeah, design is just like any other job and any other major. College and higher level education is still in the picture for many people. <br><br>
                To give you some much needed perspective, 68% of us have a bachelor's degree and 17% of us have a masters degree. And I mean, there are some of us that really love school so 1% of us have doctorate degrees. 
<br><br>
                So yeah, we do go to school for “that”. Late nights, early classes, strict teachers, mid-day naps, coffee by the gallon, you know how it is, but we’d agree that it’s a pretty good time. </p>
                <br><br>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                So what’s the post-grad life like then? <span style="font-weight:700">At the end of the day isn’t a job just a job?</span> Doesn’t the daily grind just kind of kill the “fun” of it? </p>
                <br><br>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                Well, post meeting lifelong friends, learning new things, having that one “legendary” spring break, and hoping not to trip when getting our diploma, like you, post-grad, we land a job and become a full-time “adult”. 
<br><br>
                And this job just keeps giving, 64% of us describe our jobs as pretty good. 16% of us describe it as the best. 
<br><br>
                Of course, we have some negative responses, 18% of us describe it not as good, but MAYBE they just haven’t found their fit yet. 
<br><br>
                But, honestly, 82% versus 18% negative, I think that’s pretty damn self explanatory of whether the daily grind “kills” the fun…you can be the judge. </p>
                <br><br>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    <span style="font-weight:700">Okay, so where do even you all live?</span> What’s that whole situation like? </p>
                <br><br>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                We’re actually pretty well scattered through the US. 28% of us find ourselves in the west coast. With the surge in start-ups, agencies and companies placing more importance on company culture, the west coast has proven to be extremely desirable. 
<br><br>
                34% of us work in the north-east… and from what I heard, New York does have the best slice in the states, so a great job, great food, and experiencing all four seasons, seems like a good time. 16% of us are in the South and 22% of us are in the mid-west. 
<br><br>
                So, yeah, we’re kinda all over the place… but obviously, in the best way possible. </p>
                <br><br>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    Alright, well, what about <span style="font-weight:700">diversity in terms of ethnicity?</span></p>
                <br><br>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                Despite the design industry pushing for more inclusivity, we have seen less diversity then we would like. 68% of us are white or caucasian with other following in 12%, asian in 10%, hispanic in 7% and black or african american in 3%. 
<br><br>
                Design is all about giving a voice to people, giving them a platform and inciting conversations. We recognize that upping our numbers in diversity will open us to a whole new realm of perspectives, insights and culture. 
<br><br>
                We’re trying, we’re pushing for it. It’s important to us! Touch base with us again in a couple years, hopefully we’ll be able to put our money where our mouth is. </p>
                <br><br>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    Hold on, hold on, can we talk a bit about your jobs again? <span style="font-weight:700">Do you guys even get any benefits?</span> </p>
                <br><br>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                Big interests about the job aspect, huh? Well back-tracking a bit, being happy and in a cool office isn’t the only benefit design jobs provide. Yeah, I know… real benefits! 
<br><br>
                Almost all of us have dental care insurance, so don’t be shocked when we flash you that million dollar smile during your morning commute (that many of us get covered by our jobs aka commuter benefits). 
<br><br>
                Or maybe we’ll see you on vacation with our paid time off or maybe we’ll catch that ab machine after you at the gym with our fitness benefits. I can go on and on, but maybe we can just list them over protein shakes? </p>
                <br><br>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    Alright, reel the jokes in. I still have some questions. I’m itching to know if you’re going to myth bust the idea that professionals in art don’t make <span style="font-weight:700">real money?</span></p>
                <br><br>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                That whole idea is so ridiculous. The pay isn’t shabby at all. 
<br><br>
                43% of us are making up to 50K and 42% are in the 51K-100K bracket. We got 15% in the 101K-250K and the lucky few in the 250-1M+ bracket (I know…we got some big ballers in our ranks).
<br><br>
                So yeah, myth busted. </p>
                <br><br>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    Alright, alright. <span style="font-weight:700">But are you really learning new stuff during your job? Is there even that much stuff to learn in design?</span> </p>
                <br><br>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                The modern work world is exciting cause we’re saying goodbye to all those dystopian grey matrix-cubicles and promoting a better learning environment that’s conducive to sprouting inspiration. 
<br><br>
                Look, we’re talking, 43% of designers saying they’re learning new things everyday, 41% some things and a 2% bunch saying nothing… which I know, is a little pessimistic, huh? 
<br><br>
                But there’s always gonna be a couple of Debbie Downers and definitely a TON more to learn. </p>
                <br><br>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    Well, at least there is no way you guys are working that many hours. <span style="font-weight:700">Isn’t design pretty okay with dilly-dally work hours or something?</span> But I get it, the 9-5 lifestyle isn’t for everyone. </p>
                <br><br>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                First of ALL, we’re sick and tired of this assumption. Hold back your urge to ask me at the thanksgiving dinner table with every extended family member present if I should reconsider design. Then it sets off our aunt to chime in that it’s true, a friend of a friend’s cousin’s step brother’s friend studied art and now bounces between his coffee shop job and drawing caricatures in Times Square. 
<br><br>
                Yeah, ok, vivid scenario, but… let me show you these SUPER normal job hours. 44% of us are putting in 40 hours and 33% in the 41-50 hour range. 
<br><br>
                I know! We’re also in the complain about the 9-5 complaining culture! As a designer! (A relatively enjoyable 9-5 though, if we do say so ourselves).
<br><br>
                Thank u, next. </p>
                <br><br>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    Okay, so <span style="font-weight:700">are you basically just making posters or whatever every 9-5 of your entire life until you retire</span> or something? </p>
                <br><br>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                Nah, a huge plus of a design career is that it’s not boring!! 
<br><br>
                49% of us have changed our focus area 1-2 times. Following in line, 24% haven’t changed our focus area at all. That’s the kind of flexibility and opportunity that design provides and then it’s up to us whether we want to change or not. 
<br><br>
                There’s a pretty solid chance you won’t be doing the same routine every day until retirement, which is a pretty big deal considering that many people are stuck doing the same thing everyday. 
<br><br>
                The mobility for change exists, so in the wise words of Sharpay Evans (yeah, high school musical reference) out with the old and in with the new!</p>
                <br><br>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    Wait… <span style="font-weight:700">so does that mean that your jobs aren’t very stable?</span> </p>
                <br><br>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                Don’t get career focus changes confused with job stability! 
                57% of us claim they have fairly stable jobs with 25% following with rock solid as a descriptor of their job stability. With the increase in venturing into start ups and such, the job stability scope isn't really the same as it use to be. 
<br><br>
                Younger people tend to jump around, change their jobs, so stability doesn’t factor in as much when chasing dreams. While as people age, they can still find that comfort in jobs with stability and AMAZING perks I mentioned before — talk about a career that caters to all age groups!</p>
                <br><br>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    Fine fine, last question. No offense, but what’s the <span style="font-weight:700">long term stuff and skills that design can bring into the future?</span> </p>
                <br><br>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                Has the no offense thing ever worked where prefacing something with that not come off as offensive? 
<br><br>
                It’s fine, on a more serious note, the room for design to grow has only become more prevalent. With out currently political, economic and social climate, design will be able to promote values and ideas representative of our changing times. 
<br><br>
                Our adaptability to social and tech changes allow us to always be able to withstand any change in our society. In addition, our constant consideration of empathy in our designs and trying to understand human behaviors allow us to break down complex issues and communicate ideas and facilitate conversations that have to be had. </p><br><br>
